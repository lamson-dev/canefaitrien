	Hi we have an Android program! I don't know if you can test it without getting the android ide but here's what to do:
-Get the ADT for eclipse from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
-Uh, that page should tell you what to do. You'll need to set up an Emulator, unless you have a Android Nexus phone. You will need to create an emulator with the WXGA720 skin for it to work properly. 
-Sorry for having it so complicated; start a new game and have fun!
